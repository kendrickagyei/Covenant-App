# Backend Preparation Guide

This document explains exactly what needs to change when you are ready to add a backend (database plus API). No code has been changed yet. This is a blueprint for future work.

---

## Overview

Currently, all data lives in data.js (bundled sample data with 68 dummy records) and localStorage (imported CSV/JSON data via the Settings page).

When you add a backend, the flow will change to: Frontend (React) talks to an API (e.g. Express or FastAPI) which talks to a database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).

The data.js file will be replaced by real database queries. The data import feature will upload to the server instead of localStorage.

---

## What Stays the Same (No Changes Needed)

These parts of the code are backend-ready and do not need modification:

| File | Why It Is Ready |
|---|---|
| src/renderer/src/store/dataStore.js | Centralized data access — change getData() to call an API once and every page benefits |
| All chart *Data.js files (6 files) | They receive records as a parameter — no direct data dependency |
| src/renderer/src/chart/*.jsx (chart components) | Receive records as props — purely presentational |
| src/renderer/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx | Calls getData() and passes records to children |
| src/renderer/src/pages/Transactions.jsx | Calls getData() — just swap the source |
| src/renderer/src/pages/Expenses.jsx | Form is ready — just change handleSubmit to POST to API |
| src/renderer/src/pages/Portfolio.jsx | Calls getData() — minor change |
| src/renderer/src/pages/Support.jsx | Calls getData() — minor change |
| src/renderer/src/pages/Settings.jsx | Import UI is ready — just change importData() to upload to server |
| src/renderer/src/components/Sidebar/sideBar.jsx | Pure UI — no data dependency |
| src/renderer/src/App.jsx | Routing and theme — no changes needed |

---

## What Needs to Change

### 1. dataStore.js — The Only Critical Change

Current behavior: Reads from localStorage or falls back to data.js.

For backend: Replace the internal logic to call your API.

```jsx
// BEFORE (current — frontend only)
export const getData = () => {
  const stored = localStorage.getItem('covenant-imported-data')
  if (stored) return JSON.parse(stored)
  return defaultData
}

// AFTER (with backend)
let cachedData = null

export const getData = async () => {
  if (cachedData) return cachedData

  const response = await fetch('https://your-api.com/api/records')
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch data')

  const json = await response.json()
  cachedData = json
  return json
}

// For components that cannot use async (like initial render),
// you can keep a sync fallback:
export const getDataSync = () => cachedData || defaultData
```

Files affected: Only dataStore.js.
Files that automatically benefit: Dashboard.jsx, Transactions.jsx, Portfolio.jsx, Support.jsx, Expenses.jsx.

---

### 2. Expenses Form — Submit to API

Current: Logs to console.
For backend: POST to API.

```jsx
// BEFORE
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  console.log('Submitted Form Data:', formData)
}

// AFTER
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  const response = await fetch('https://your-api.com/api/records', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(formData)
  })
  if (response.ok) {
    // Refresh data or show success
  }
}
```

Files affected: Only Expenses.jsx.

---

### 3. Data Import — Upload to Server

Current: Saves to localStorage.
For backend: Upload file to server.

```jsx
// BEFORE (in Settings.jsx)
importData(parsed)
refreshDataInfo()

// AFTER (in Settings.jsx)
const response = await fetch('https://your-api.com/api/import', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(parsed)
})
if (response.ok) {
  setStatus({ type: 'success', message: 'Data uploaded to server' })
}
```

Files affected: Only Settings.jsx.

---

### 4. data.js — Remove or Replace

This file contains 68 dummy records. Once the backend is live:
1. Delete or archive data.js
2. The dataStore.js fallback can return an empty object like { church_expense_tracker: { records: [] } }
3. Or keep it as a "seed data" reference for the database

Files affected: data.js (delete) and dataStore.js (update fallback).

---

### 5. monthlyLineData.js — Module-Level Import

This file still imports data.js at the module level (lines 3-13 pre-fix). We already fixed it, but just be aware — the fix converts it to a function so it is already backend-ready.

---

## Suggested API Endpoints

You will need roughly these endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /api/records | Fetch all records (returns an object with church_expense_tracker and records array) |
| POST | /api/records | Add a new record |
| POST | /api/import | Bulk import records (CSV/JSON) |
| DELETE | /api/records/:id | Delete a record |
| PUT | /api/records/:id | Update a record |

The current frontend uses this data structure:

```json
{
  "church_expense_tracker": {
    "congregation": "Church Name",
    "currency": "GHS",
    "period": "January to June 2026",
    "records": [
      {
        "id": "001",
        "date": "2026-01-04",
        "type": "income",
        "category": "Offertory",
        "subcategory": "Sunday Offertory",
        "amount": 1850,
        "remarks": "First Sunday offertory",
        "recorded_by": "Treasurer"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Your backend should return data in this same shape so the frontend works without changes.

## Technology Suggestions

| Layer | Options | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backend Framework | Express.js (Node), FastAPI (Python), Flask (Python) | Express is easiest if you are already using JS |
| Database | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite | SQLite for simplicity, PostgreSQL for production |
| ORM | Prisma (JS), SQLAlchemy (Python) | Helps with database queries |
| Auth | JWT tokens, session-based | You may want login for different churches |
| Hosting | Railway, Render, Fly.io, DigitalOcean | All have free tiers to start |

---

## Migration Strategy (Step by Step)

1. Build a simple API that returns the same JSON structure as data.js
2. Update dataStore.js to call your API endpoint
3. Test — the app should work exactly as before, just with real data
4. Add mutation endpoints (POST/PUT/DELETE for records)
5. Update Expenses.jsx to POST new records
6. Update Settings.jsx import to upload to server
7. Remove data.js or keep as seed reference

## Summary: Files That Need Changes for Backend

| File | Change Required | Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| src/renderer/src/store/dataStore.js | Replace localStorage/fallback with API calls | Medium |
| src/renderer/src/pages/Expenses.jsx | Change handleSubmit to POST to API | Low |
| src/renderer/src/pages/Settings.jsx | Change import to upload to server | Low |
| data.js | Delete or archive | Low |
| Everything else | No changes needed | None |
